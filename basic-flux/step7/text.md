Now, we install a helm release:

```
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: default
spec:
  interval: 10m
  timeout: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: podinfo
      version: '6.5.*'
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: podinfo
      interval: 5m
  releaseName: podinfo
  install:
    remediation:
      retries: 3
  upgrade:
    remediation:
      retries: 3
  test:
    enable: true
  driftDetection:
    mode: enabled
    ignore:
    - paths: ["/spec/replicas"]
      target:
        kind: Deployment
  values:
    replicaCount: 2
```{{copy}}


(Mini-)Challenge
----------------

1. Create a file named `helm-release.yaml` in `mycluster/clusters/killercoda/podinfo`{{}}, commit and push it.
2. Again, force a reconciliation of the git repo
3. Wait for the `podinfo`{{}} pods to become ready.


CoPilot's explanation of `driftDetection`
----------------------------------------

Drift detection is an essential feature for infrastructure as code (IaC) practices, ensuring that the actual state of your infrastructure matches the expected state defined in your codebase. When drift detection is `enabled`, it performs continuous monitoring of your deployed resources, looking for any changes that weren't initiated through the IaC process. This capability is vital for security, compliance, and operational integrity, as unauthorized or unintended changes can introduce vulnerabilities, inconsistencies, or operational issues.

The `ignore` section within drift detection settings is particularly useful for managing dynamic or ephemeral changes that are expected as part of normal operations. By specifying paths or resources to be ignored, you can fine-tune the sensitivity of drift detection. This ensures that the system focuses on significant drifts that could impact the stability, performance, or security of your infrastructure, while ignoring benign changes like auto-scaling events, which are reflected in modifications to `/spec/replicas` in Kubernetes deployments.

In essence, drift detection acts as a safeguard against configuration drift, helping teams maintain control over their infrastructure's state, reduce the risk of outages or breaches, and ensure that deployments remain consistent with their intended design.
